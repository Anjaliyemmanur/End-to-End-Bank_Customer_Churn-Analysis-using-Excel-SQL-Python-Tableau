**Insights**:
Churn is statistically associated with Geography, Activity Status, and Number of Products (p-values ≪ 0.05), confirming these are true churn drivers and not random patterns.
The difference in average balance between churned and retained customers is statistically significant, indicating that higher balances do not guarantee loyalty.
Gender shows statistical significance due to large sample size, but the practical business impact is limited, as the gender split remains broadly balanced.
Based on chi-square tests and t-tests, the strongest predictors are:
Age – churn increases in older age groups
Activity status – inactive customers churn nearly 2× more
Number of products – single-product users show higher churn
Geography – Germany exhibits significantly higher churn
Balance – churned customers hold higher average balances
Variables with weak or no predictive power:
Tenure
Estimated salary
Credit card ownership

Predictive Analyis(Conceptual)
Can churn be predicted using available customer attributes?
-	Which variables are the strongest predictors of churn?- Answered using Statistical Analysis in the aforementioned section.

**Insights**
Analysis of customer attributes shows that several variables have a statistically significant     
relationship with churn, meaning they contain predictive information.
From SQL analysis, chi-square tests, and t-tests, the following attributes were found to be strongly associated with churn:
•	Age (higher churn in older age groups)
•	Activity status (inactive members churn nearly 2× more)
•	Number of products (single-product customers churn more)
•	Geography (Germany shows significantly higher churn)
•	Balance (churned customers hold higher average balances)
